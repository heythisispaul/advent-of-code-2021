# advent-of-code-2021

Just keeping this here for fun. The goal is to complete 2021 AoC in both TS and Rust as a fun way to make the holiday season even more busy for some reason.

## Running The Challenge Code

After cloning, install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

- Include all AoC input values as text files in a top level `inputs` directory. Each file should be 'day' and then the two digit day it represents (eg, `day01.txt`)
- The TS files can be run with the command `test`. Provide it the two digit day and the challenge number you want to run. For example: `npm run test 01 1` to run day 1, challenge 1.
- The results will be logged in the console.

Looking forward to more challenges this year!
